# Hamilton 68 Chrome Extension
This project was created during the 2018 [CredCon](https://www.credcon.org/) hackathon. It's a Chrome extension that detects whether an article is potentially linked to Russian influence efforts, as determined by the [Hamilton 68 dashboard](https://dashboard.securingdemocracy.org/).
